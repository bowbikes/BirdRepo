# Animated Bird Migration Visualization

This repository contains the data processing code used to generate the datasets for the **Animated Bird Migration Map**, a data visualization final project built with D3.js and Observable.

🔗 **Final visualization**: [View it on Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/33932507daed5631)

## 🐦 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to visualize migratory bird patterns across North America using USGS bird banding data. The final result is an animated, interactive map that displays:
- Individual flight paths of birds over time
- Clustered group movements (representing flocks)
- Seasonal patterns and behavioral trends

The project combines spatial and temporal data to tell a compelling story about avian migration.

## 📁 Repository Contents

This repo includes the data wrangling and transformation scripts that were used to prepare the raw banding data for visualization.
